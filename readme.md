## Kinetic Art Computing Engine
I love the idea of computing with rolling balls. Impractical, but beautiful. I
wanted to explore some ideas of how it could be done and it makde more sense to
build the models virtually than physically. This project is the result.

Demo: http://projects.adamcolton.net/kace/

### Todo
* Remove old and inefficient linked-list implementation, use newer graphics
engine.
